# FANCY
Dataset for Natural Language Inference (NLI)
FANCY (FActivity, Negation, Common-sense, hYpernimy), is a new dataset with 4000 sentence pairs concerning complex linguistic phenomena such as factivity, negation, common-sense knowledge, hypernymy and hyponymy.

For each one of the phenomena taken under consideration, we produced 1000 couples of sentences (Premise and Hypothesis). We labelled them with the expected output for the NLI task (entailment, neutral, contradiction).

Furthermore, for each phenomenon, we added some columns that better specify the kind of sentence pair (e.g. which kind of common-sense, or which kind of hierarchical relation)
